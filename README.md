 <!-- How to get smooth start -->
## How to get smooth start

- It is recommended to not start from the scratch.
- Study the documents regarding the previous groups.
- It is highly recommended to get in touch with the Tech United team and use the Tech United repository in case of using TURTLEs. <br />
  Some of the people that you can get in touch with:<br />
  Tech United Website: https://www.techunited.nl/en/<br />
  Tech United (Techunited@tue.nl)<br />
  René van de Molengraft - Project Sponsor and Technical Consultant (M.J.G.v.d.Molengraft@tue.nl)<br />
  Ruben Beumer (r.m.beumer@tue.nl) <br />


- Ask for permission for using the surveillance cameras at the Robotics Lab.
  You may contact Ömür Arslan (o.arslan@tue.nl) to ask for the permission.
- Get in touch with MSD2023-25.
- Get in touch with Matthias Briegel<br />
  Matthias is the person who has previously worked on developing AutoRef system and he may share some interesting ideas for the development of the AutoRef system. (matthias_briegel@hotmail.com)

## Reference

Github repository cohort 2022-2024 
---------------------------------- 
The 2022-2024 MSD team used the stadium cameras to record the videos. The objective was to check whether the teams follow set piece protocols, that is team positioning. Validated the model for corner kick, since this is a common set piece. The validation was not real-time, rather done on a recorded video.

Github repository cohort 2021-2023 
---------------------------------- 
The 2021-2023 MSD team used the robot players as “referee” to collect data for the decision-making algorithm. Using Tech United Data, the team designed, implemented, and tested the "ball rolling for a distance greater than 0.5 m" and the “ball IN/OUT of play” tasks. Moreover, the team recorded a real game of two against two robots to validate the algorithm created in Matlab.
