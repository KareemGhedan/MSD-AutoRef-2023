## Reference

Github repository cohort 2022-2024 
---------------------------------- 
The 2022-2024 MSD team used the stadium cameras to record the videos. The objective was to check whether the teams follow set piece protocols, that is team positioning. Validated the model for corner kick, since this is a common set piece. The validation was not real-time, rather done on a recorded video.

Github repository cohort 2021-2023 
---------------------------------- 
The 2021-2023 MSD team used the robot players as “referee” to collect data for the decision-making algorithm. Using Tech United Data, the team designed, implemented, and tested the "ball rolling for a distance greater than 0.5 m" and the “ball IN/OUT of play” tasks. Moreover, the team recorded a real game of two against two robots to validate the algorithm created in Matlab.
